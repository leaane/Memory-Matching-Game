A memory card matching game using GUI. The program has two game modes, one player and two player (user vs AI), and three game modes (easy, medium, hard). 
There are an even number of cards in which each card has a pair and all the cards are kept facing downwards. The cards have to be flipped one by one, and 
when two cards get matched, the cards will remain flipped and be disabled to prevent it from being flipped back over. When there’s no match, the cards remain 
in the same position and are flipped back over. Cards are shuffled before each game to make sure every game is different.
